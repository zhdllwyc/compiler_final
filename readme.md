# Implementing BFS and PageRank with SYCL

This repository contains code written for a final project in CS380: Advanced Topics in Compilers at UT Austin. SYCL (https://www.khronos.org/sycl/) is a C++ framework for GPU computing, based on OpenCL. It is cross-platform compatible and significantly easier to use than architecture-specific languages such as CUDA. The goal of this project was to write SYCL applications for two standard graph algorithms: Breadth First Search and PageRank. We aimed to match CUDA performance on these tasks.
